The app enables real-time tracking of stock, barcode scanning, and SKU identification, allowing store owners to compare actual versus expected inventory levels. With advanced error handling to manage discrepancies and a receiving tool that generates CSVs for supplier comparisons, M2 InstaCount provides an efficient and accurate solution to inventory management challenges."
